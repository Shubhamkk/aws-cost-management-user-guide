# Using Identity\-Based Policies \(IAM Policies\) for Billing and Cost Management<a name="billing-permissions-ref"></a>

This topic provides examples of identity\-based policies that demonstrate how an account administrator can attach permissions policies to IAM identities \(users, groups, and roles\) and thereby grant permissions to perform operations on Billing and Cost Management resources\.

For a full discussion of AWS accounts and IAM users, see [What Is IAM?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_Introduction.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

For details about AWS Cost and Usage Reports permissions, see [Controlling Access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/controlling-access-cur.html) in the *Cost and Usage Reports Guide*\.
